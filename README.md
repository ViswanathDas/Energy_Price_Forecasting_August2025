# \# Energy Price Forecasting

# 

# \## Project Overview

# This project explores day-ahead electricity price data to identify time-based patterns and forecast future trends. The goal is to build an end-to-end data pipeline that cleans raw energy data, visualizes market behavior, and implements a basic forecasting model.
